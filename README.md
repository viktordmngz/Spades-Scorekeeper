This is a scorekeeper file for the game of Spades. The card game has taken over my friend group's game nights, and so I made this to make scorekeeping easier.

I'd recommend following the Google link and saving a copy of the file so you can play around with it on your own. The scorekeeper was originally built in Sheets, so the Excel file may behave differently.
For instance, the conditional rules for the winning scores may not work in the Excel file or you may get a NAME ERROR when all you have to do is reselect the cell and hit enter.


To start, I'd recommend using the sheet titled "Simple 2 - Best" in either version. Here, you will only need to enter in each player's bids and wins to calculate each round's score. The total score will be updated as the game goes on.
The players are put into their teams and the first dealer of the game is deemed as "Player 1". The person across from them (their teammate) is deemed "Player 3". In my opinion, the "Simple 2" sheet is the best to use during games.
It is intuitive and easy to see the total scores as well as each team's performance round-by-round. Players can also see their own individual performances and make changes to how they bid/play. Exciting stuff!


For the "Complicated" sheet, you only need to enter in the bids and the wins like you did with the other sheet. However, there is a lot of extra information that I decided to put into the sheet.
Things such as "Team Bids" and "Round Bags" that are not explicitly in the other sheet are present here. There is also a "Bag Total" at the bottom so teams can easily track how many bags their team has, even in the tricky negatives.
This sheet's layout also tends to be more confusing for new players. I would recommend only using this when playing with experienced players.


For the "Simple 1" sheet, I designed it based on a scorekeeper used in an app I have. My goal was to just put in any bonuses such as nils and bag resets manually whenever they occur.
Otherwise, the principle is the same and you only need to enter in the bids and the wins. The main difference here is that the bids and wins are done as a team rather than as individual players.
The total score is not calculated since the round score is constantly updating. If nothing else, this sheet could be printed out and used along with a pencil for simple scorekeeping.
The main issue here is when the teams go negative, it gets a little more difficult to calculate bags by hand. Nevertheless, I included this sheet so that others can use it if they want.


If you find any scenarios where the scorekeeper makes a mistake, please feel free to reach out to me and let me know so I can fix it. Otherwise, enjoy testing and using my scorekeeper :)
